Sp_ScriptFor:

This procedure returns an object buld script as a single-row, single column
result.
Unlike the built-in OBJECT_DEFINITION, it also does tables.
It copies the SMO style where possible but it uses the more intuitive
eay of representing referential constrants and includes the documentation
as comments that was, for unknown reasons, left out by microsoft.
You call it with the name of the table, either as a string, a valid table name,
or as a schema-qualified table name in a string.
